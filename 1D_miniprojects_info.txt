Windows
Unbuntu easier, commands exist

Using a terminal:
cd - change directory. cd .. goes up 1 folder
pwd, ls, dir in Unix

green - a function
e.g.
transcrypt (a programme in your computer) - needs an argument
translates to JavaScript, creates a file in .js
ONLY DO ONCE, it already created a taget library in your static folder, will continue to 'translate' whatever you have edited in your python library

Web browsers understand JS not Python.

Using virtenv, install everything there if you dont want it in your com. (clutter computer)

What is Flask doing?
- browser is a web client, requests in this address (url): the page you want
- flask sends the html file you want in this format. html is only a way to render things out (you can open it in your browser as well)
- when you click on the url, flask server sends a different html file to show you. 
routes.py - shows you which links/paths to go to. (protocol - client can request and send things to server)
- flask server sends html to your browser, browser requests for what the file wants, to library.js.
- even if flask is closed, tab can still run the code, since the script that is running is already there.
client side computation. the browser does the work. static side. server has already sent all the code that the browser needs to do.

...?
* client requests (by clicking on things, interacting on a web browser), browse requests from the server. *
